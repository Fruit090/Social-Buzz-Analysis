# Social-Buzz-Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aimed to support Social Buzz,a growing social media platform, in preparing for a successful IPO.The focus was to identify the top 5 most popular categories on the platform by analyzing user engagement and performance data. Insights from this analysis were presented to stakeholders to inform content strategy and business decisions.

### Data Sources

The data was sourced from Social Buzz's internal datasets, which include three datasets- Reactions,Content and Reaction Types.

### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel - For cleaning,merging,and analyzing data
PowerPoint - For creating the final presentation slides

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

To ensure accurate analysis,I performed the following data cleaning and preparation steps-
1. Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset and focus on relevant variables.
2. Corrected data entry errors and ensured accurate labeling of categories for clarity.
3. Merged datasets from multiple sources to create a unified and comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
To better understand the dataset and guide my analysis, I explored questions such as:

1. What is the overall distribution of key variables in the dataset?

2. Are there any noticeable outliers or anomalies that need attention?

3. How do different variables correlate with each other?

4. Are there significant differences between categories or groups within the data?

5. What trends or patterns can be observed over time?

6. Which variables appear to have the strongest influence on the target metric or outcome?


### Data Analysis
After preparing and merging the datasets, I conducted a detailed analysis to identify Social Buzz’s most popular content categories:

- Merged three datasets into a single, unified dataset to enable comprehensive analysis across all relevant variables.

- Calculated total and average engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for each content category.

- Ranked categories based on overall engagement to determine the top performers.

- Compared engagement distribution between the top 5 categories and all remaining categories.

- Analyzed time-based trends to identify periods of peak activity and engagement.

- Assessed year-on-year and month-on-month performance to detect emerging popular categories.

- Summarized patterns and insights to guide Social Buzz’s IPO strategy and content optimization.


### Results/Findings
The analysis produced the following key results:

-Top 5 Categories Identified – Food-related content dominated, with “Healthy Eating” ranking as the highest-performing category.

-Thematic Insight – The prevalence of food themes suggests a strong audience interest within Social Buzz’s user base.

-High Engagement Opportunity – Collaborations with healthy eating brands and targeted campaigns could further boost engagement levels.

-Volume Insights – January recorded the highest number of posts across the dataset, with 1,897 unique categories identified overall.

-Niche Popularity – “Animal” posts received notably high reactions, showing potential for audience-specific engagement strategies.


### Recommendations

-Leverage High-Performing Categories – Prioritize content creation and promotion within the Healthy Eating category, given its top engagement performance.

-Develop Brand Partnerships – Collaborate with healthy eating and wellness brands to create sponsored content and campaigns that align with user interests.

-Capitalize on Animal Content Popularity – Launch niche campaigns featuring animal-related posts to capture and grow this engaged audience segment.

-Optimize Posting Schedules – Use insights from peak posting months (e.g., January) to plan seasonal campaigns when engagement is naturally higher.

-Diversify Emerging Categories – Monitor and invest in fast-growing categories to diversify engagement sources and reduce over-reliance on a single theme.

-IPO Readiness Strategy – Use category performance data to position Social Buzz as a platform with a highly engaged and well-defined audience, boosting investor appeal ahead of the IPO.

### Limitations

-Data Scope – Analysis was limited to the datasets provided for the proof of concept (POC) and may not fully represent Social Buzz’s entire content library.

-Time Frame – Insights were based on a specific time period; engagement trends may shift over time and require ongoing monitoring.

-Content Classification – Categories relied on existing labels, which may contain inconsistencies or subjective assignments.

-Engagement Metrics – Only available engagement measures (likes, shares, comments) were analyzed; other important factors such as watch time or click-through rates were not included.

-External Factors – The analysis did not account for external influences (e.g., marketing campaigns, viral events) that may have impacted engagement.

-IPO Context – Recommendations were derived from content engagement patterns only, not from a full market or financial analysis.
