# Social-Buzz-Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aimed to support Social Buzz,a growing social media platform, in preparing for a successful IPO.The focus was to identify the top 5 most popular categories on the platform by analyzing user engagement and performance data. Insights from this analysis were presented to stakeholders to inform content strategy and business decisions.

### Data Sources

The data was sourced from Social Buzz's internal datasets, which include three datasets- Reactions,Content and Reaction Types.

### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel - For cleaning,merging,and analyzing data
PowerPoint - For creating the final presentation slides

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

To ensure accurate analysis,I performed the following data cleaning and preparation steps-
1. Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset and focus on relevant variables.
2. Corrected data entry errors and ensured accurate labeling of categories for clarity.
3. Merged datasets from multiple sources to create a unified and comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
To better understand the dataset and guide my analysis, I explored questions such as:

1. What is the overall distribution of key variables in the dataset?

2. Are there any noticeable outliers or anomalies that need attention?

3. How do different variables correlate with each other?

4. Are there significant differences between categories or groups within the data?

5. What trends or patterns can be observed over time?

6. Which variables appear to have the strongest influence on the target metric or outcome?


### Data Analysis
After preparing and merging the datasets, I conducted a detailed analysis to identify Social Buzz’s most popular content categories:

- Merged three datasets into a single, unified dataset to enable comprehensive analysis across all relevant variables.

- Calculated total and average engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for each content category.

- Ranked categories based on overall engagement to determine the top performers.

- Compared engagement distribution between the top 5 categories and all remaining categories.

- Analyzed time-based trends to identify periods of peak activity and engagement.

- Assessed year-on-year and month-on-month performance to detect emerging popular categories.

- Summarized patterns and insights to guide Social Buzz’s IPO strategy and content optimization.
